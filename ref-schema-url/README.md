RefSchemaUrl uses a regular expression to validate the urls. If the regex is updated, it can be tested against different valid and invalid strings in `test/regex.spec.js`. It can be tweaked or edited [here](https://regex101.com/r/gM5cU5/1) along with the test cases.

More information on the url structure can be found [here](https://s1seven.github.io/SEP/schemas/#versioning)
